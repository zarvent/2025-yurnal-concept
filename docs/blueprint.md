## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming light-blue (#ADD8E6), promoting relaxation and introspection. This also serves as a base hue that will be shifted in brightness/saturation for other color roles.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated blue (#F0F8FF, also known as AliceBlue), provides a soft, unobtrusive backdrop that doesn't distract from content, promoting relaxation and introspection. The lightness is appropriate for a light scheme.
- Accent color: A gentle, muted lavender (#E6E6FA), creating a contrast with the primary color without being overwhelming. In HSL space, lavender sits 'left' of light-blue on the color wheel, qualifying it as analogous. Also known as Lavender.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that blends a modern look and some warmth. Since the application may need to show some paragraphs of text in places, we prefer to pick a font good for both headlines and body.
- Simple, minimalist icons representing each section and template.
- Clean, uncluttered layout with plenty of white space to reduce cognitive load.
- Subtle transitions between sections to maintain a sense of calm and flow.
